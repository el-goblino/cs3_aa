        I want to leave a message to whoever finds this, so that they would know what happened to this place. <br>
        Many stores come and go, and the old one ended like most of them do, abandoned and unmaintained. Eventually, it falls apart. <br><br> 


        Since no one owns the place now that the owner has abandoned it, some opportunists could start their own store in its ruins.
        Who knows? Maybe someone could make a better one that can be more successful than the one before it.
